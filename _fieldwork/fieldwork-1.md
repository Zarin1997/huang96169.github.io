short:  We are using ADCP (Accoustic Doppler Current Profiler) to measure river discharge, bathymetry, and flow velocity. 
 This photo was taken during a test run on FIU campus with Olu, who is a PhD student at another lab led by Dr. Scinto. We are comparing the data collected from our lab's ADCP and that from Dr. Scinto's lab with different settings.
