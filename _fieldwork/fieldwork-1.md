 We are using ADCP (Accoustic Doppler Current Profiler) to measure river discharge, bathymetry, and flow velocity. 
 This photo was taken during a test run on FIU campus with student and postdoc from another lab. We are comparing the data collected from our lab's ADCP and that from another lab with different settings.
